Executive Summary:
	Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a common issue amongst US military members, with almost a quarter of soldiers during the Global War on Terror experiencing some form of a TBI [1]. Symptoms are variable but can lead to a wide range of consequences, such as lack of focus, spatial misperception, blurred vision, difficulty walking, or even changes in breathing. Such issues can have severe ramifications for soldiers on and off the field; therefore, we propose an EEG monitoring system integrated into the helmets of military personnel to output brain signal data to soldiers and military leaders for the purposes of monitoring general brain health, activity, and potential for TBI. Electrodes located throughout the helmet and connecting to a microprocessor at the back will be responsible for picking up EEG signals, which can then be processed and provided to military persons of interest. 
	While EEG devices and protective helmets are in development or on the market, a combination product that integrates monitoring capability along with protective capability does not currently exist. In addition, a military-specific design that has rugged reliability and the ability to be used in harsh conditions is not available or in development. 

Prototype: 

Our product requirements for the EEG helmet prototype are to design a reliable device capable of capturing accurate brainwave signals using an array of eight electrodes. The prototype must be housed securely within a helmet and incorporate a form factor that supports consistent electrode contact with the scalp. Standards applicable to this device include those pertaining to the biocompatibility of materials used, such as the SLA print for electrode holders, and electronic safety and data protection standards for devices interfacing with Arduino and Bluetooth components (Figure 1).
The prototype construction involved several critical stages. Initially, a CAD model was developed to create a resin form factor that integrates into the helmet, positioning the electrodes optimally for signal acquisition. Elastic bands were employed to ensure electrodes maintain adequate pressure for consistent skin contact. The electronic circuitry includes an Arduino Uno, an accelerometer, an Adafruit Bluetooth module, and an ADS 1299 denoising chip to capture and process the EEG signals. A custom SLA mount for the Arduino was also designed and fitted onto the back of the helmet. 
The military helmet is designed to safeguard soldiers by monitoring for traumatic brain injuries in real time. At its core, the helmet features strategically placed EEG sensors within its lining, interfaced with an Arduino Uno microcontroller for robust data acquisition and processing. This setup ensures minimal interference with the helmet's structural integrity while providing crucial health data. With its dual focus on safety and usability, our prototype maintains the traditional look and feel of military gear, allowing for seamless integration into soldiers' equipment. Its design reflects a commitment to operational excellence, comfort, and the well-being of military personnel in the field.
